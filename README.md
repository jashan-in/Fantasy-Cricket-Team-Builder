Fantasy Cricket Team Builder
Project Overview

This project is a Fantasy Cricket Team Builder inspired by apps like Dream11.
The main idea of this project is to allow users to view cricket players, create a fantasy team, and see upcoming matches.

For Sprint 1, the project is kept static and simple. The focus is on setting up the project structure, components, styling, and teamwork rather than advanced features.
